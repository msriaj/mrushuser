                                and the company continues to make wavesin the
                                industry with new innovations and cost efficient
                                pricing. Since Rushlaunched its new website in
                                May of thisyear to complement its Official
                                Account on WeChat, the company has
                                successfullycompleted over 8 000 deliveries and

                                month-on-month. As South Africa’s premier
                                courier aggregator,Rush offers customers both
                                choice and convenience, building its
                                valueproposition on combining trusted couriers
                                which can then be chosen based onreputation,
                                price or delivery time. Glenn Whittaker, founder
                                and CEO of Rush SouthAfrica, explains that the
                                company’s first anniversary affords it
                                theopportunity to not only look back at how far
                                it has come in a short space oftime, but also to
                                continue to focus on the future, by constantly
                                innovating tostay ahead. “Recently, we added a
                                payment gateway thatenables users to save their
                                credit card details securely on the system.
                                Thismeans they no longer have to input the same
                                details repeatedly when sendingmultiple parcels
                                and it makes it more convenient for business
                                owners who cannow delegate such duties to
                                employees, as they will be able to access
                                thecompany’s payment details,” he says. “Another
                                innovation has been the launch of ane-wallet,
                                which allows users to pre-load any amount from
                                R2 500 all theway up to R100 000. In this way,
                                regular deliveries are automatically paidfor,
                                and – in order to easily facilitate the topping
                                up process - Rush willnotify the company once it
                                has used up 90% of the value of its e-wallet.”
                                According to Whittaker, as we head towards
                                theFestive Season, the demand for parcel
                                deliveries is expected to increasesignificantly.
                                Rush has therefore added a shopping basket
                                facility, whichallows companies needing to send
                                multiple deliveries to various clients to logon
                                and perform multiple operations in a single
                                session. “We are also in the process of adding
                                newcouriers to our platform and our customers
                                can expect to have additionalchoices by early
                                2017. Furthermore, Rush aims to continue
                                building on itsexisting strategic partnerships,
                                such as it has with Amrod Corporation. Thisgives
                                it access to some 6 000 Amrod clients, offering
                                them a quicker,easier and more convenient way of
                                delivering their parcels throughout
                                SouthAfrica.” He adds that since this time of
                                year sees somany more parcels and gifts being
                                sent, it’s the perfect time for new customersto
                                give Rush a try. Why not outsource your delivery
                                function to Rush so thatyou can focus on your
                                core business? Why stand in queues and brave the
                                trafficto send a parcel when you can use Rush?
                                Rush enables you to conduct the entireprocess
                                online, it offers a cheaper alternative to the
                                more traditionaldelivery options, while saving
                                you time. “The Rush delivery process is managed
                                fromcollection to delivery, thanks to a track
                                and trace facility linked to anonline dashboard.
                                We also provide a parcel insurance option, so
                                customers knowthat their parcel is secure
                                throughout the entire delivery and
                                fulfilmentprocess.” “Our goal has been to save
                                businesses andindividuals both time and money.
                                Rush creates large-scale cost efficiencies
                                forcompanies, while reducing the headaches that
                                parcel delivery can cause forindividuals.
                                Ultimately, by making the courier experience
                                simpler, faster andcheaper, we are able to give

                                month-on-month. As South Africa’s premier
                                courier aggregator,Rush offers customers both
                                choice and convenience, building its
                                valueproposition on combining trusted couriers
                                which can then be chosen based onreputation,
                                price or delivery time. Glenn Whittaker, founder
                                and CEO of Rush SouthAfrica, explains that the
                                company’s first anniversary affords it
                                theopportunity to not only look back at how far
                                it has come in a short space oftime, but also to
                                continue to focus on the future, by constantly
                                innovating tostay ahead. “Recently, we added a
                                payment gateway thatenables users to save their
                                credit card details securely on the system.
                                Thismeans they no longer have to input the same
                                details repeatedly when sendingmultiple parcels
                                and it makes it more convenient for business
                                owners who cannow delegate such duties to
                                employees, as they will be able to access
                                thecompany’s payment details,” he says. “Another
                                innovation has been the launch of ane-wallet,
                                which allows users to pre-load any amount from
                                R2 500 all theway up to R100 000. In this way,
                                regular deliveries are automatically paidfor,
                                and – in order to easily facilitate the topping
                                up process - Rush willnotify the company once it
                                has used up 90% of the value of its e-wallet.”
                                According to Whittaker, as we head towards
                                theFestive Season, the demand for parcel
                                deliveries is expected to increasesignificantly.
                                Rush has therefore added a shopping basket
                                facility, whichallows companies needing to send
                                multiple deliveries to various clients to logon
                                and perform multiple operations in a single
                                session. “We are also in the process of adding
                                newcouriers to our platform and our customers
                                can expect to have additionalchoices by early
                                2017. Furthermore, Rush aims to continue
                                building on itsexisting strategic partnerships,
                                such as it has with Amrod Corporation. Thisgives
                                it access to some 6 000 Amrod clients, offering
                                them a quicker,easier and more convenient way of
                                delivering their parcels throughout
                                SouthAfrica.” He adds that since this time of
                                year sees somany more parcels and gifts being
                                sent, it’s the perfect time for new customersto
                                give Rush a try. Why not outsource your delivery
                                function to Rush so thatyou can focus on your
                                core business? Why stand in queues and brave the
                                trafficto send a parcel when you can use Rush?
                                Rush enables you to conduct the entireprocess

                                you time. “The Rush delivery process is managed
                                fromcollection to delivery, thanks to a track
                                and trace facility linked to anonline dashboard.
                                We also provide a parcel insurance option, so

                                businesses andindividuals both time and money.

                                parcel delivery can cause forindividuals.
                                Ultimately, by making the courier experience

                                successfullycompleted over 8 000 deliveries and
                                it is now seeing its delivery figuresdoubling
                                month-on-month. As South Africa’s premier
                                courier aggregator,Rush offers customers both
                                choice and convenience, building its
                                valueproposition on combining trusted couriers
                                which can then be chosen based onreputation,
                                price or delivery time. Glenn Whittaker, founder
                                and CEO of Rush SouthAfrica, explains that the
                                company’s first anniversary affords it
                                theopportunity to not only look back at how far
                                it has come in a short space oftime, but also to
                                continue to focus on the future, by constantly
                                innovating tostay ahead. “Recently, we added a
                                payment gateway thatenables users to save their
                                credit card details securely on the system.
                                Thismeans they no longer have to input the same
                                details repeatedly when sendingmultiple parcels
                                and it makes it more convenient for business
                                owners who cannow delegate such duties to
                                employees, as they will be able to access
                                thecompany’s payment details,” he says. “Another
                                innovation has been the launch of ane-wallet,
                                which allows users to pre-load any amount from
                                R2 500 all theway up to R100 000. In this way,
                                regular deliveries are automatically paidfor,
                                and – in order to easily facilitate the topping
                                up process - Rush willnotify the company once it
                                has used up 90% of the value of its e-wallet.”
                                According to Whittaker, as we head towards
                                theFestive Season, the demand for parcel
                                deliveries is expected to increasesignificantly.
                                Rush has therefore added a shopping basket
                                facility, whichallows companies needing to send
                                multiple deliveries to various clients to logon
                                and perform multiple operations in a single
                                session. “We are also in the process of adding
                                newcouriers to our platform and our customers
                                can expect to have additionalchoices by early

                                building on itsexisting strategic partnerships,
                                such as it has with Amrod Corporation. Thisgives

                                them a quicker,easier and more convenient way of
                                delivering their parcels throughout
                                SouthAfrica.” He adds that since this time of

                                you time. “The Rush delivery process is managed
                                fromcollection to delivery, thanks to a track

                                Ultimately, by making the courier experience
